You bought some fresh fish, a sea bream, which you put in your freezer to cook later. A few days later, you went on vacation to Honolulu. You spent two wonderful weeks there, enjoying beautiful,sunny weather. You were lucky, because during this time, it was snowing in Paris. There was even such a snowstorm that electricity was cut off throughout Paris for a week. Far way from all this, in Honolulu, you continued to enjoy beautiful days at the beach. Back in Paris, you resume your normal Parisian life. The weekend arrives and you invite a few friends for lunch.",I cook the sea bream and serve it to my friends.,I don't cook the sea bream and instead I serve something else to my friends.,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No
